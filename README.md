# ethereum-scanner


This is a bot that scans recent Ethereum ERC20 transactions from https://etherscan.io/tokentxns. As of now, the parameters are set so that it checks the site every 20 seconds and filters out for tokens that have been transferred less than 100 times. I made this as an attempt to find tokens that were just released and could have a major pump. It's still a work in progress! I don't recommend immediately buying into these tokens. I don't have any actual stats, but any of these brand new coins could very well be a rug pull / exit scam, so do your research on these new coins.


You can see the output for the tokens it finds here: https://discord.gg/uRPbUB
